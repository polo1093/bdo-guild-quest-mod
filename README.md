#Guild Quest Condition-Objetive Pre-Viewer [Updated on 12-10-2016]

* What is it?

This is a simple language file mod that works standalone (do not require any other tool or file installation).

* Whats used for?

This is used to make possible to see guild quests requirements/conditions to be completed BEFORE you accept it (normaly you can only see/know that information after taking the quest, sometimes ending with a bad choice).

* How to use it?

Download zipped file from Git.
With the game client closed, extract zipped file contents folder to your Black Desert Game "MAIN FOLDER": 
(it should create a new folder there called "prestringtable", inside must be other folders called "en","de","fr" and inside each folder 4 xlsm files).

Now run game client using ENGLISH, DEUTSCH, FRENCH as your configured game language, after entering game, press "G" and check guild quests tab, you must now see all resumed infos about quest conditions to complete before you choose to accept or not.
Update this folder/files once per week when retail servers update/mantainance.

* What to avoid?

If your launcher updates game client somehow, you must NOT use this files/folders, so in that case delete/remove "prestringtable" folder within all the files inside and wait for my update on this topic.

# FAQ

* My client crashes on loading/startup;
Your prestringtable folder/files are outdated due to client updates, delete the folder and wait for me to update the files on this topic.

* How do i know if my folder/files are updated or valid?
check zip file name "date" or check this topic "expiration/validity dates"

* Can i be banned for using this?
Same thing as using pyx, scripts etc, yes you can, but since this method is being used by me and thousands of other players from KR,JP,RU during 2 years without any issues, you can chill.

* Can i re-share, re-link or sell this files?

Answer is obvious: you must not, i wish this to be keept free and public and mainly to Pyx Forum users, since they requested me this work. of course i accept any donation/help anyone is kind to make.
